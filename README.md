# LinReg_Assessment

Goal of this project is the evaluation of various Linear Regressors. 

Using Kaggles Capital Bike Share dataset from Washington D.C. (which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data), an exploratory data analysis is performed to extract trends and features from the data that might be useful for feature engineering. \
While the jupyter notebook goes through the process step by step, the python script just outputs the relevant results as plots.

The selection of Regressors to test was inspired from this excellent article by Q. Lanners
